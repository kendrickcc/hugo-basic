# hugo-basic

 Basic Hugo site

## setup

Edit `baseof.html` with latest [bootstrap getting started](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/).

Choose the section that includes bootstrap.bundle but replace with bootstrap.min if poppers are not needed.

Create `script-footer` and edit along with `head`.
